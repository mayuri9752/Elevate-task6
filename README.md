Tested Passwords & Results
#	Password	Strength	Estimated Crack Time	Feedback Summary
1	apple123	Weak	< 1 second	Common pattern, lowercase + numbers only
2	ApPlE2025	Fair	~1 minute	Better with mixed case but still predictable
3	Appl3!	Fair	~5 minutes	Short, basic symbol use, leetspeak guessed
4	L!ght#House88	Strong	~2 years	Good length, symbols, and mix of characters
5	X#5rTz8!Pl9@	Very Strong	~millions of years	High entropy, random, long
6	summerholiday	Weak	< 1 second	Common word, no numbers or symbols
7	Tr0ub4dor&3	Good	~3 days	Modified dictionary word, leetspeak pattern
8	P@55w0rd!	Very Weak	< 1 second	Common substitution, easily guessed
9	M&xT93*vLk2P@	Very Strong	~trillions of years	Excellent complexity and length
10	Password123	Very Weak	< 1 second	One of the most common passwords
Explanation of Password Strength Ratings
Weak / Very Weak
•	Example: apple123, Password123
•	Issues: Short, predictable, common words or patterns, low character variety.
•	Vulnerable to: Dictionary attacks, brute force.
 Fair / Good
•	Example: ApPlE2025, Tr0ub4dor&3
•	Improvements: Used of upper/lower case and some symbols.
•	Still vulnerable to: Pattern recognition, educated guesses.
Strong / Very Strong
•	Example: L!ght#House88, X#5rTz8!Pl9@, M&xT93*vLk2P@
•	Strengths: Long length, high entropy, randomness, use of all character types.
•	Resistant to: Brute force, dictionary attacks, guessing.
Best Practices for Strong Passwords
1.	Use at least 12–16 characters
2.	Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols
3.	Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns
4.	Do not use common substitutions (@ for a, 0 for o, etc.)
5.	Avoid reusing passwords across platforms
6.	Use a password manager to generate and store passwords
How Complexity Improves Security
•	More characters exponentially increase crack time.
•	Unpredictable symbols and random sequences block dictionary and pattern-based attacks.
•	High entropy means the password doesn’t follow human-like logic—harder for attackers to guess.
 Conclusion
Password strength is not just about including symbols—length, randomness, and unpredictability are crucial. Avoid using memorable but guessable phrases. Instead, use complex, long, and unique passwords for maximum security.
